# MartLib
A bunch of random functionality and tweaks I've added to my Minecraft server.

# Modules
<h3>All modules are toggleable in the config. Do <code>/martlib:reload</code> to reload the <a href="https://github.com/Guedosha/MartLib/blob/main/src/main/resources/config.yml">config</a> after making changes</h3>
<h5>Book Signature:<br>Adds a /sign command to allow multiple players to sign the same book</h5>
<h5>Bushmans Bow:<br>Functionality for a custom item on my server</h5>
<h5>Cultist Banner:<br>Adds a command to give the player a banner coresponding to their team. Currently hardcoded but will be configurable in the future</h5>
<h5>Death Coordinates:<br>Sends a message to a player after they die containing their death coordinates. For Java Edition players, it will send a hoverable message to show the coords that can be clicked to copy to clipboard. For Bedrock Edition players, it will just send the coordinates to the player</h5>
<h5>Easy Raid Evokers:<br>Functionality for a compromise my players made to allow raids to spawn evokers while keeping our server in easy difficulty</h5>
<h5>Global Freeze:<br>"Freezes" all players who don't have the martlib.globalfreeze.move permission</h5>
<h5>Invincibility Frames:<br>Adds a configurable window of invulnerability when players join the server</h5>
<h5>Player Logger:<br>Logs certain player actions such as dying, sleeping, changing dimensions, using creative, etc</h5>
<h5>Schizophrenia:<br>A W.I.P module that i've remade and deleted several times. In its completed form, it will be a way for admins to troll players by making them question their sanity</h5>
<h5>Seasonal Items:<br>A module that prevents players from using items with &5Verified in their lore. It was made to allow players to keep a box of sentimental items from the previous season while preventing them from gaining an advantage</h5>
<h5>Simple Spleef:<br>A simple spleef mechanic that puts snow ball items directlyin the player's inventory when the break snow blocks and makes snow balls instantly break snow blocks</h5>
<h5>Stop Sounds On Death:<br>A minor tweak I made because I was annoyed it isn't vanilla behavior. The explanation is in the name</h5>
<h5>Warden Boss:<br>A W.I.P. module to add a custom warden boss. Currently cincomplete and is disabled by default in the config.</h5>
<h5>Warden Heart Fix:<br>A patch for a custom item on my server that allowed players to dupe experience</h5>
